# Project Manager
It is an cli/tui utility that helps me keep track of my projects.

## Project status
all tracked projects have an status.toml file in their root directory, it holds all the project info, and the features that are done or unfinished
each feature an name, priority, difficutly, priority, and optionally a subfeature, and description.
